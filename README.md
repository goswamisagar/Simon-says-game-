# Simon Says Game

## Overview

The "Simon Says" game is a fun and challenging memory game where players must repeat a sequence of colors generated by the computer. The sequence starts simple and progressively gets more difficult, testing the player's memory and reaction time.

This version of the game is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- Color sequence generated by the computer
- User clicks on colored buttons to repeat the sequence

- Visual and sound feedback for correct/incorrect moves
- Game resets on failure with a game-over message

## Technologies Used

## How to Play

1. The game will generate a random sequence of colors.
2. The sequence will light up one color at a time.
3. After the sequence is shown, the player will need to click on the colored buttons in the same order.
4. If the player matches the sequence correctly, the game will generate a new, longer sequence.
5. If the player makes an incorrect move, the game ends, and a "Game Over" message is displayed.
